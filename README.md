# Louisville Police Data Analysis

This project analyzes data from the [Louisville Open Data API](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/), focusing on police officer salaries, citations, and working hours from 2020 to 2023. Our primary goal is to investigate whether an officer's working hours have a direct effect on the number of citations they issue. Additionally, the project examines broader trends in salary budgeting and overtime spending.

### Project Objectives

- **Correlation Analysis:** Determine if there is a relationship between the hours worked by officers and the number of tickets they issue.
- **Budget Review:** Assess trends in salary allocations to understand how budgeting is impacted by officer hours and citation rates.
- **Overtime Spending:** Explore patterns in overtime spending across different departments and positions within the police force.

### Data Sources
The data sets are sourced from the Louisville Open Data API, providing official and publicly accessible records. The data currently includes:

- Louisville Metro Government salary information
- Citation records from 2020 to 2023 
- Also I have a freedom of information request data set of officer names and badge numbers.
