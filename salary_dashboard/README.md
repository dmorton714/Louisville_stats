# **Salary Dashboard**

**Status:** In the ***early stages*** — setting up data calls and usage.


## **Overview**

The **Salary Dashboard** is a data analysis tool designed to track and monitor the city's salary expenditures, ensuring that it adheres to the allocated budget. By providing a comprehensive view of the city's total salary spend, departmental breakdowns, and employee-specific salary deviations, this dashboard offers valuable insights for city administrators and financial managers.

Key features of the dashboard include:

- **City-Wide Overview:** A high-level display of the city’s total salary expenditures, comparing actual spending against the budget to assess whether the budget is being adhered to.

- **Department Breakdown:** A detailed breakdown of salary spending by individual department. This feature helps identify areas where salary expenditures may be deviating from expected amounts.

- **Top Employees:** An analysis of the top employees whose salaries deviate significantly from the expected salary figures.

- **Trend Analysis:** The ability to drill down into specific departments and years, enabling users to explore salary trends and make year-over-year comparisons.


## **Purpose**

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for ensuring fiscal responsibility in salary spending. By providing an intuitive and interactive interface, users can quickly identify discrepancies, track departmental spending, and make informed decisions about the city’s salary budget.
