## **Plotting Templates Overview:**

**Status:** Very early stages and some generic place holder ideas are in place. 

The Plotting Templates project aims to serve as a reusable source of plots and a style guide for visualizations across various projects. This tool allows users to easily generate consistent, professional-looking plots by simply calling the plotting package and providing basic input, such as the title, x and y axis labels, and plot colors.

**Key features include:**

- Consistent Visualizations: Automatically applies predefined styles, ensuring that all plots within a project have a uniform appearance.

- Simple User Input: Users only need to enter essential details like title, axis labels, and colors, making it easy to generate customized plots.

- Reusable Templates: Provides a library of pre-built plot templates that can be integrated into other projects, saving time and ensuring consistency.

- Potential for External Use: If further developed, this project could serve as a standalone package for external use, offering a consistent plotting solution for various users.

This project is designed to streamline the plotting process and maintain visual consistency across different datasets and projects.
